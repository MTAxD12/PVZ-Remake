# Plants vs. Zombies Remake

This project is a personal remake of the iconic *Plants vs. Zombies* game. It was created entirely by me as a way to challenge and improve my skills in developing 2D games using Unity. Please note that this is my first 2D game project, and all programming was done from scratch. I do not own any intellectual property rights to the assets, sounds, or concepts used in this game—they belong to their respective copyright holders.
